Your First iPhone Game!
=======================

This tutorial is going to teach you how to make your own Flappy Bird for the iPhone! Your game will be written
in Swift, a new language Apple introduced in 2014 to make it easier to write iPhone apps. You will be using a game
engine called Cocos2D that is very popular in the game industry.

What Goes Into a Game?
======================

We've set up the basic game structure for you - a background and a top bar to keep score.
Your job will be to add the main character and the obstacles. You'll then learn how to check
if the player is touching the screen to make the character jump. If the character hits an obstacle,
the game is over! Now go to the next step to start coding!
