The First Obstacle
==================

So far our character is moving and jumping but it's not really fun yet. Let's add obstacles
for you to avoid!

For that we have created a simple method for you: ```addObstacle``` To use it, in your ```initialize```
method, simply add:

	self.addObstacle()

Then run the game. You should see a random obstacle appear!

More Obstacles
==============

Now that we have one obstacle, let's add more! To do that, let's add a new variable to keep track of time passed. At the top,
below where it says ```// put variables below this line```, add the following:

	var timeSinceObstacle:CCTime = 0


What we want to do is add a new obstacle at some regular interval.
This time in your ```update``` method, try adding:
        
    	// Increment the time since the last obstacle was added
        timeSinceObstacle += delta
        
        // Check to see if two seconds have passed
        if timeSinceObstacle > 2
        {
        	// Add a new obstacle
            self.addObstacle()
            
            // Then reset the timer
            timeSinceObstacle = 0
        }

Now run the game again. See if you can make it easier or harder by making
the ```2``` higher or lower!
